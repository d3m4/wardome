These\nstones seem a little too regular, and from the circle \nformation and size you could almost swear that they were...\ncrenellations?  Could some sort of building been buried\nby the lava here?  A rusty ring sticks out of the earth\nin the center... a trapdoor?  This is almost too good to\nbe true!",
