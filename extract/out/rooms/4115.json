  "description": "You find yourself in a small passage ending.  It is quite dark in here.\nAs you look about the damp walls, you notice that the passageway almost\nappears to curve upwards towards the ceiling.  Looking up, you notice that\nthere is a small hole, just large enough to pass through.  Looking closely\nat the curved part of the wall, it appears that someone (or something) has\ncarved small handholds into the wall to ease passage upwards.  The tunnel\nitself leads off to the east.",
