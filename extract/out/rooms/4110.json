In fact, it seems that another step\nforward and you would have fallen into it.\n   The tunnel itself leads to the west, and looking down into the hole\nin the floor reveals little beyond the fact that it seems to be very\ndeep and very dark.  There is a very strange smell emanating from the\nhole, it almost smells like something down there is rotting.",
