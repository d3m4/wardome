The dancing shadows created by the\nflickering flames catch your eyes for a few minutes and threaten to\nhold you entranced.\n   Looking about the cave, it appears to continue to the east and\nsouth.",

The ceiling dips here rather surprisingly, or wait, is that because the floor climbs upwards toward it?  The tunnel seems to narrow slightly more as you look to the south, and widens up somewhat as you look northward.  The light to the south continues to flicker.",
