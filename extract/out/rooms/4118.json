  "description": "This rather large cave is surprisingly very well lit.  There are\nabout twenty torches spread about the room set in sconces which hang\nseveral feet above your head.  The dancing shadows created by the\nflickering flames catch your eyes for a few minutes and threaten to\nhold you entranced.\n   Looking about the cave, it appears to continue to the west and\nsouth.  In the north wall a strange vertical crack looks as if it may\nlead somewhere.",
