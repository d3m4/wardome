Obviously there\nis a hot spring located under the city (making the decision to put\na city here seem much more reasonable).  Closer inspection of the water\nyields a dead body floating around in it, skin melted away from months\nof floating in there.  The west wall has collapsed revealing another\ncollapsed house.",
