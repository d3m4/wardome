Far \nbelow, you see what appears to be a foot-path climb \nup to the central mountain, a peak that looks dark \nand disturbing.  You get very bad vibes from that \nmountain for some reason, and it doesn't seem like \na very good idea to try to find a way to get there.\n   The only safe way to leave this overlook is to \nthe south.",
