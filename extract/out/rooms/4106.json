The cave is lit by the eerie, soft, golden light\nwhich looks to be emanating from the walls themselves.  The cave\nitself is enormous, extending quite a distance to the east and south.\nThere is a hole in the northern wall, about two feet in diameter.\nAll that can be seen through the hole is darkness.",
