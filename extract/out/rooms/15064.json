Upon first laying eyes on this place you realize\nthat there is something funny about this settlement... there\nis no sound other that the whistling wind here.  You would have\nexpected to hear people going about their regular business, but\nthe village is silent.  You cannot see any movement around the\nvillage either.  It is almost as still and silent as the woods\nto the north.\nThere is a small sign lying by the side of the road here.",
