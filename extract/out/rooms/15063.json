The sounds of the forest can be\nheard all round and you feel a peaceful feeling come over you\nas you realize that mankind has not passed this way for some\ntime.\n   The fading trail you are on appears to have been so little\nused that it has almost completely grown over with vegitation\nfrom the woods here.  \n   The faded trail appears to lead west and south.  To the south\na strange eerie silence seems to hang in the air, almost blocking\nout all the sounds that you can hear from the north and east.",
