However, instead of seeing the \ncustomary carnage and mound of gold that one is accustomed \nto seeing in a dragon lair, this one is decorated subtly \nwith tapestries and drapes, and other comforts of human \nlife.  There is even a huge-dragon sized bed -- undoubtedly \nconjured to life by its elder dragon owner.",
