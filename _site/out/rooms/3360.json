Below, you see the path head down to a \nlarge flat area where a small cottage lies nestled in the \nmountains, smoke rising from it in a curling line.  Above, \nthe path seems to head towards that dark peak piercing the \nsky.  You notice a few boot-tracks in the earth, seemingly \nto lead down towards the cottage.",
