There is a\ndense neon blue fog hugging the floor here, making it impossible to see\nbelow your knees.  You suddenly hear mutterings coming from the back\nroom, possibly from...\nKKKKKAAAAAABBBBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!\nYou are deafened by the noise from a tremendous explosion and the\nconcussion from the blast staggers you!  The shopkeeper seems to pay\nno heed to this. The door to the back room opens and an older man,\nwearing a pointed hat, whose face is smudged with soot sticks his head\nout.  'Is everyone alright?  Sorry about that.  I was testing a new\nspell.  I'll try to give advance notice next time.', he says.  The door\nthen closes.",
