  "description": "This is the Magical Experiments Laboratory.  Dark smoke-stained stones\narch over numerous huge oaken tables, most of these cluttered with strange-\nlooking pipes and flasks.  The floor is covered with half-erased pentagrams\nand even weirder symbols, and a blackboard in a dark corner has only been\npartially cleaned, some painful-looking letters faintly visible.  A well in\nthe middle of the floor leads down into darkness.  Vile smells waft from the\ndepths.",
