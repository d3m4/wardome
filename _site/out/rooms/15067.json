This pit appears\nto be a mass grave for the citizens of the village.  There are\nbones and corpses lying all over the place.  A lot of the corpses\nlook too recent to be from the Townsbridge murders of almost a\ndecade ago, but the village seems to have been empty for almost\nthat long.\n   The dirt road leads away from the carnage to the north.",
