Boxes and crates are stacked against the walls, and \na beat up oaken desk stands near the door stacked with \npapers written upon by an unsteady hand.  Some large \nlanterns keep the place very well lighted.",

From somewhere deep in the  recesses of the cave, you hear a faint, rhythmic thumping  sound distorted by the passage's strange acoustics.",
