  "description": "You are walking along a narrow dirt path through the lush, green,\nfresh Midgaard countryside.  You can see to the horizon to the north\nand east; the busy city of Midgaard lies to the south.  All around\nyou is healthy green grass and an occasional large oak tree.  The sun\nfeels wonderful on your face and a pleasant wind blows through your\nhair.  Birds chirp quietly to themselves and you can smell the faint\nscent of flowers and freshly cut grass.  You feel like you could lie\ndown in the grass and stay here forever, surrounded by powerful beauty\nin all directions.\n   There is a large rusty gate sitting in a stone archway just to the\nwest.",
