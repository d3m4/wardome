  "description": "As you move away form the open air into the darkness of the path\nand the sinister looking woods around you, you get a feeling of awe\nand something almost akin to horror.  The wood around is completely\nsilent, not even the rustling of leaves or the cracking of branches\nbreaks the silence.  The final thing you notice is that the darkness\nall around you seems to be almost contrived, and doesn't seem natural\nfor this kind of vegitation.\n   The path continues west and you can see light to the east.",
