The clay road appears to lead through the\nfoothills towards the snowcapped mountain chain to the west.  Perhaps\nthere is a city or settlement in that direction.\n   You cannot see any breaks in the horizon of the sand which fills your\nvision as you look to the east, it seems to stretch forever.",
