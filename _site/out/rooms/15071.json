There is almost nothing left of the roof that would have\nonce covered this building, and the north and east walls have been\nburnt to almost half the height of the other two walls.  There are\nsome burnt goods around on the ground and the remains of a counter\nnear what is left of the north wall seems to indicate that this was\nonce a shop.\n   The road lies to the west through the blackened wall.",
