  "description": "You find yourself on a mountain trail twisting down towards a small\nhidden valley located in the shadow of another mountain a short distance\nto the east.  The trail is fairly rough going and looks to dip down into\nthe small valley before climbing up the side of the other mountain.  As\nyou look at the valley from a closer vantage point, you realize that it\nis much smaller than you had expected, being maybe thirty feet long.  It\nis quite surprising how deceptive distances can be this high up in the\nmountains, isn't it?",
