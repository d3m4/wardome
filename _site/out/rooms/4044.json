  "description": "You find yourself inside a rather large cavern.  The ceiling stands\nat least twenty five feet above you, if not more.  The walls are so far\naway, that the shadows of the room obscure them almost completely.  Out\nof all of the grandeur in this cave however, nothing seems to catch your\neye quite as much as the enormous table standing in the middle of the\nsandy floor.  It stands tall enough for you to walk under it without the\nneed to hunch over.  A large tunnel leads out of the eastern wall of the\ncavern.",
