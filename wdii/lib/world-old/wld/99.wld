A barrow mound.~
  You are standing atop a barrow mound which is about 15 feet in 
diameter.  There is no vegetation inside the circle, strangely 
enough.  A low cumulous of swirling mist engulfs you from the 
knees down, making it look as though you are partially buried.

City limits of Ghenna.~
  You are standing inside the city limits of Ghenna.  Once a booming 
barter town, it is now a haven for the evil which it bred over long 
years under the rule of the hubristic Lord Suzerain.  In virtually 
every corner you see ruins of some sort or another intermingled with 
old, age-whitened bones from all manner of beasts. 
  Exits lead in all cardinal directions.

A fountain of tears.~
  A large fountain containing the tears of those slain within the 
city limits has been erected here, abutting the east wall of the 
city - it looks quite deep and wide.  The water is a crystaline blue 
which exudes holiness, something quite strange for such an evil city.
  Exits lead West, North and South.

The smell of death.~
  You are standing in what appears to be the town graveyard.  
Nobody feels the need to bury the dead, so the corpses are just 
strewn about in no particular order.  And the smell, oh boy!  
It's all you can do to keep from losing your lunch right now.  
  The corpses are stacked too high to exit East, but you can 
pass North, South or West.

  The incessant wailing of souls in torment causes visible shivers 
up and down your spine.  The walls, floor and ceiling are a viscous, 
blood-red mass that eludes description.  A rift in the ceiling above 
you causes a slight breeze to ruffle your hair.  A magic portal stands 
south, leading into the unknown.

looking bar to the north which seems to be moving somehow.  Next to 
the bar a stairwell disappears into blackness above.  The ceiling is 
vaulted, and sports three candeled chandeliers, which hang like 
victims above you.

ALIVE!

witnessed at the entrance is much larger here, apparently you are onto

Lair entrance.~
  This is an arched cavern of great size - it looks like the Houston 
astrodome.  a great ledge of rock juts out above your head, showering 
you with a steady gush of blood and entrails.  A raucous sound of 
crunching viscera, intermingled with a slurp here and there, turns 
your stomach.  Then you hear it... an encouraging voice which keeps 
repeating "Yes, yes, thats it... just a few steps more...You're almost 
there."

  This ledge is slippery with the blood of hundreds of vanquished 
adventurers who made the mistake of entering here.  Corpses, corpses, 
everywhere.  At least you finally found the source of that horrific 
sulfur smell.  A black, steaming substance is smeared all over the 
walls emitting the funk.  As if this werent bad enough, you suddenly 
have the feeling that your life is about to end soon.

Abode of the Efreeti.~
  You have entered the magical abode of the great Efreeti.  Done in 
an eastern motif, this room glimmers with all the amenities one could 
want.  Pillows, rugs and candelabra are everywhere.  This definitely 
looks like the lap of luxury.  To the North lies the forbidden treasure
room, to enter it is to ask for certain death.

Certain Death.~
  You have made a foolish mistake, my friend.  This is the Genie's 
equivalent of the forbidden fruit.  A giant hand emerges through a 
rift in time and squashes you flat, like a bug.

(how nice).  Walls stand to the west, north and south - but the way

from happier times.  The only apparent exit is back to the West.

A quivering jaunt.~
  You have entered a quivering jaunt.  It feels like you are in the
belly of a giant beast.  The mucuslike walls are a deep red color 
that thrums with energy.  The only exit is North.

A quivering jaunt.~
  This room moves so much that you have a hard time keeping your feet.
The red mucus is hanging from the walls and ceiling in tenebrous 
strings that look quite sickening.  A dark spot on the West wall 
hints at the only possible exit.

The lair of the Deepspawn.~
  You have entered a 20 foot square opening that appears to be a lair 
of some sort.  Bones lie strewn about in every corner - most of them 
appear to be human bones.  A big pile of treasure sits in the center 
of the room covered with the red mucus that lines the walls here.  
Exits lead in all cardinal directions.

A dead end.~
  The street dead ends here in a twisted mass of brambles.  A high 
city wall looms over you to the West.  It seems the only exit is 
North.
