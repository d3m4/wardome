A Narrow Crawlway~
Ouch! You can barely squeeze through this passage, which is only a
foot and a half high.  It was also hidden behind a stone block; that
is, no doubt, the reason the goblins have not tried to follow you, 
being too weak to move it.  You, however, can still shove it aside, 
should you wish to slither north.  The wide passage to the 
south looks much, much more inviting, however.

A Tunnel in the Mountains~
It is very easy to walk here.  A forgotten river has carpeted this cave
soft, sandy clay, and streaked the walls with frozen ripples.
The north wall has a small crack in it, and to the south this wide
tunnel becomes higher, and slightly narrower.  A shadow on the west
wall implies a tunnel mouth, leading out of your lantern's reach.

A Tunnel in the Mountains~
What a lovely place!  It is not wide here - your shoulders fit, with
little room for company.  You judge the cavern roof to be at least 70
feet above your head.  Crystal formations in the rippled walls split 
torchlight into countless sparks of flame, reflected from the
quartz veins which embroider the stone in a timeless brocade. The
walls are mainly vertical, but taper outwards enough to support a block
of breakdown, hanging like Damocles' sword, fifteen feet up. I doubt 
it will fall, however.  The tunnel is lower but wider to the north.
A small stream trickles from a tiny hole, high up on the wall, to exit 
through a small tunnel to the south.  To the east, a larger cave
continues to a bend.  That boulder troubles you.  Anxiously you examine 
its support, and notice some writing on the wall.
There is a NEWLY CARVED SIGN here. Read it!

A Narrow Ledge~
The stream plunges downward, to join another, which foams and rages far
below you in a deeply cleft canyon.  You hear nothing above the water's 
roar.  Like a cat you tread on a spray-wet ledge only six inches wide.
Not a nice place.  You do not look down as you continue.  A traveler
must count courage among his baggage, no? Perhaps you will be repaid.  
Through the mists to the south you glimpse a golden gleam.  To go there
you must creep cautiously along a ledge too narrow for a surefooted
cat, and slippery as fish skin.  It is not too late to turn back!
A narrow crevasse leads down the cliff, but only an acrobat
could turn round and descend it. Your nose brushes an inscription.

You have found the lost mine! Chunks of gold ore litter the ground, as

haste to enter the mine, and gather the riches therein, you step from 
the tiny ledge to the broad flat table of stone near the mine entrance.  
That is, you try to step that way...
Your feet slip. Oh dear.

A Short Tunnel~
This tunnel does not go very far.  Soon it bends again to the south.   
A strong draft blows from there.  The walls here are no longer 
rippled, but smooth, and covered with writing.  There are many small 
inscriptions, but you can only read three: one in orcish,
another in common, and a third, written large by a firm hand,
in the secret dwarven tongue.
Looking closer, you see another, in ogrish.

The Tunnel's Entrance~
O traveler from Midgard, your journey has not ended, but begun! You are
just inside a cave entrance.  It stretches far into mountain-darkness.
Just to your east, an underground stream leaves a lower cave.  If the
the same water flows inside the cave, it must have passed under your 
feet at a lower level, for it is in a gorge seventy or more feet deep.
To your south you see the smooth line of a road cutting the woods.
A sign is carved into the stone here.

Here you may borrow, or buy, much of the great literature of Ofingia, 
which sadly does not fill very many of the shelves here. Once this
library had many more works, but the goblins have raided this town 
several times in the last few years and burned or stolen most of 
those that were reported to be magical.  One of the walls has a huge
oil portrait hanging where there are no shelves.
Looking about you, you are amazed at the number of books still left,

The Secret Library Vault~
Wow! There is enough dust here to grow a crop of corn on the shelves.
But there may be even more interesting things on the shelves than 
corn.  Why, on that shelf just out of reach, you see a book that
has to be the Book of Dwarven Herblore. Too bad you can't get it; it 
would be useful to a wizard. A few torn off pages litter the lowest 
shelf, nearer at hand than the great dusty tome.

Long was this wisdom lost to men, and long did it lie deep, deep 
buried beneath the goblin caves. But the brave Nambor did fetch 
back a tattered scroll, bearing a few runes of ancient Dwarven,
who only I, Bog Grundelgrin, could read. Now mark well my words,
O enchanter, for if you take the leaf of the mevais plant ground
to a paste with water from the Well of Jakur, you may make an
ointment, which heals all wounds. But it is hard to prepare. The
ground leaves must have been picked under the dying moon of late
November, when the mevais is dry, and browned.  Then they must be

small vellum~
Like the rest it is a fragment:

The age of Iron came next; it is our present age. In these days men
dwindled both in stature and nobility still further from the Bronze
Age, so say the philosophers. They began forging their tools and 
blades of iron, and no longer wrote the great epics of the last Age.
Death still reigned, and reigns, over the world of men, cutting 
short their little works. How large they seemed! Yet all is not lost.
So says the philosopher:
              To the world that stumbles lost and lone,
              A king descends from heaven's throne. 
              Death by death is overthrown.

Here the page has been torn off.
~
E
large red~
It is from a book called "The Art Of Battle". The language is archaic,
the handwriting bad, and the ink faded.

How fortunate is the army which counts [?] a master [illegible] in its 
ranks! For where the glaive has bitten, he may heal and, even, by the
[illegible] restore a dying warrior to life and bodily vigor. And even
before the trumpet cries or drums beat these are of use, for the King 
of heaven favors the man of good heart who looks for aid [?] And it
may even happen that by his blessings the sword will miss where it 
would have hit.
And in weaponry: I say to you, grasp your spear in the hands, reaching
the right as high as may be, and four feet longer should be its length.
But though it may be longer, never should it be less, for this has been
the death of many a good knight.  An excellent arm is the spear, which 
easily may slay a man armed with a long sword, for it keepeth its wielder
at a distance. But for the man who travels alone, seeking to make himself
a name, I do not advise the spear, for it is too long a weapon for the 
woods or caves.  Take instead a sword, and if you be a child of rock [?]
a smaller axe than the armies carry. And I say too, that the club is a
very [illegible] arm, good for the merchant or traveller on lonely roads.
The wise travel together, but the fool strikes out alone, saying I will
save my gold, [illegible] not paying for idlers. But the night grows dark,
and in a lonely place bandits set upon him, kill him, and take his gold,
which he had so tried to save.  His bones they leave as a [illegible] to
his brotherhood [?] everywhere. We see, then, that the small sword, tho'
more costly, is better by far than the club in battle, and in turn 
cheaper, and less good, than the long sword, or the broad sword.  And in
turn the two-handed sword, or claighmore, passes these in price and worth.
The axe and mace I love less, for my hands are suited to the sword, which

Unfortunately, there is no more.

papyrus scroll fragment~
Some ancient scribe has written a list of legendary weapons, of which  
only this tiny scrap remains.

The great warrior Highlander, it is said, bore a mighty claymore, the
equal of which is unknown to me.  I have heard it glowed brightly when
drawn, but I see no way this would be useful. The great smith Durgandon
forged it in the dwarven halls; its enchantment is opposed to any evil
and protects its wearer from harm, it is said.  I know not if this is
true. The blade is known to me only in legend; if indeed it ever was, 
it is now lost forever.  No word of Highlander has been heard for long.
Zebenak Rykalp of Wazen bears a sword made by the smith Dorig, of the
Foehammer clan.  Its name is Krat, or "Razor" in the Vallonian tongue,
named for its thinness, and its renowned edge.  It is supple steel,
but quite sturdy, and I have seen Zeb plunge it deep into an oak without
injuring the blade. Dorig is truly a great craftsman.  
There are dark rumors of a scimitar borne by the Goblin King that, if

Here is the end of the Great Hall.  Its size awes you.  The King,
however, is not here, and his throne is dusty.  With his people

that village now live here, or in Venango.  The Sheriff has not
retired his post; no, he moved here because from here he now commands
a small band of guards who go out hunting goblins, intending to 
free the countryside eventually.  A tattered sign and a newly printed

This is the famed Crossbow, known all over Korbor's kingdom, where 
the food is fine and the beverages more or less legal.  Reilly Morgan

would gladly let you sample the booze.  Or perhaps you prefer beer?  
His brew is second to none, better than the Grunting Boar's swill.

And it really IS a mess, too.  Bones of all sorts lie tramped into the
sandy clay floor.  Often they still have quite a lot of meat left on
them. Goblins are quite apt to bite something and throw it away, 
though it comes from a king's board.  Grotesque green-skinned warriors
of all sizes and degrees of hideousness mill about, chewing on meat,
whose origins you do not wish to know. The east smells like a knacker's

bellows which work so well for dwarves, and it is run by several
