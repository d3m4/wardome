Inside a Tavern~
   You are inside a dimly-lit room.  The atmosphere makes you feel
uncomfortable.  In front of you stands a mysterious gypsy.  She whispers 'Your
fate and destiny lie beyond this world.  ' You are still wondering what she
means when you suddenly notice the crystal ball ...  It glows fiercely and
displays the Universe!
