Inside the Chapel~
You are in a small, dark chapel.  The dark brown glass in the tiny windows
do not let much light through.  A few rows of worn wooden benches stand here.

Whoever built this place must have been very rich indeed!  Though you did
enter through a rather small door this place has enough room to hold several
score of people.  The floor has a beautifully woven carpet, and the walls are
covered in finely crafted tapestries. You can tell that these things must have
been worth much but they have not lasted well throughout the ages.  Massive
doors lead off to the south and a large stone staircase leads up.

conquered as well.  Though Crotus was a goodly king, it was rumored that he

The Gilded Hallway~
Ancient etchings and writing in intricate gold and silver designs fill these
walls.  You are tempted to linger and examine them closely.  Your light source
flickers off the walls showing you exits north.

The Short Way to Hell ...~
You fall ...
            hmm .... it's getting really HOT!
You fall ...
                        you fall ...
     Slowly you are cooking as you fall further ... your skin is burning and
your hair evaporates ...

                                           you fall ...

                 and fall ...

                                     and STOP...!!

Welcome to HELL!

But even in Hell we give you another chance.

Inside the coffin~
You are inside a coffin.  It seems rather cramped in here.  You can climb
up out of the coffin, or you can wait for here the real occupant to join you.
