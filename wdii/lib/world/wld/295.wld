flight. If they could fly the war would have ended years ago. You chuckle

The Horse~
This is a broad clearing full of tradesmen and a huge, half-finished wooden
horse. You see scattered about the clearing wooden rabbits, badgers, stoats,
turtles, hawks and echidnas. Evidently a lot of thought went into the final
choice for the lure...

The Battlefield~
You are walking across the battlefield before the walls of Troy, where the
besieging army of the Achaeans, led by Agamemnon, have sat encamped for
years, the monotony only broken by the occasional battle. Tents lay
everywhere, housing the many soldiers that currently call this place home.

Diomedes' Tent~
This is the tent of Diomedes, King of Argos, the most amicable and well-
liked of the Achaean leaders on the field. He is also a competent warrior
and military leader, and engenders great likeness and respect from the
troops.
