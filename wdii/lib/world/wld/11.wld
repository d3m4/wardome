A dark tunnel~

you must crouch to avoid hitting your head.  The tunnel continues north and
south.  To the west you see a Shirriff Post while to the east lies a small
home.  All you can see is darkness.

Shiriff Post of the Lower Shire~
You are in the shiriff Post which acts as the nucleus for the three shiriffs 
of the Lower Shire.  As you examine the shiriffs on duty, you come to realize
that the halflings of the Shire are not to be reckoned with.  You cower with
awe.  The only exit is to the east.

A halfling hole~
You stand inside a rather crudely built halfling hole.  The many passageways
and winding paths remind you of a rodent's lair.  The air is musty and damp
and you feel the need for fresh air.

&cThe &YK&ying's&c Resting Room.&n~
   You are in a very confortable rest room. Here Azoun cames when

There is a bed in the center of the room, with many soft &MPurple 
pillows&n.The walls is nice decorated with pictures of nature,
friends, and his wife, &CThe Grand Mistress of Magic&n. You feel 
an agradable sensation of peace and calm in the room. Amazing 
place to sleep you think...but only if you're a guest of Azoun, 
if not... sorry, but intruders are not welcome.

&gA&mnother &GD&mimension&n~
   &nYou are in a strange dimension. You should not be here if you don't have the
&WU&wt&Wh&wa &WS&wp&Wi&wr&Wi&Wt&n, the Spirit of the Shamans.
When you look around, you can see thousands of ancient shamans that would love
to share some experience with you.
This dimension, or some parts of it, is used like a armoury by the experienced
shamans, which leave their war equipments here. This corner of this dimension
is used by &mM&mark &cKazhisky&n, who loves to rest in his bed and drink some
cold bear when he is not seeking for the evil mage that hold his mother in its
power.

armas e armaduras velhas, enferrujadas.  Mais encontra armaduras e armas de
grandes mestres guerreiros.  Armas de magos muito consegtuados tabem.
